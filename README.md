### SENG 440 Project
## Embedded Systems
# Overview

This project is to implement mu-law for audio-compression and optimize the algorithm. The first implementation is my original view of the problem without thought of speed or performance. The second iteration shows the various methods used to improve the speed of the algorithm. There is a VHDL model that describes what a hardware assist would do and some of the assembly instructions are replaced in the last iteration with this hardware assist. More detailed information about the aspects of project can be found in the report folder.
